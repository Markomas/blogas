So, I decided, that probably a good idea is to learn GoLang.
For some time I was thinking, what should I do with Go? 
Should I implement Levenstein distance algorithms and compare performance? - Useless, there are multiple implementations already, too academic
Should I implement MySQL UDF? - as a first project, it scares me to mix C and Go, so maybe should be a second project.
Should I create something that downloads videos, for future projects? - maybe
