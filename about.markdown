This page created because I am about to lose my job as a developer ðŸ˜ž

And finding a new job is realy hard (at the time of writing, I have my job for at least ~4 months, maybe more, because office is closing and most positions are moving to cheaper countries, that's what we know).

The hardest thing for me during interview is to prove what I know and what I can.

So, to calm my self, I will start to document my personal projects, IT activities, etc. And maybe, just maybe, that would be usefull for others.
