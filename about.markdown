This page was created because I am about to lose my job as a developer ðŸ˜ž

And finding a new job is really hard (at the time of writing, I have my job for at least ~4 months, maybe more, because the office is closing and most positions are moving to cheaper countries, that's what we know).

The hardest thing for me during the interview is to prove what I know and what I can.

So, to calm myself, I will start to document my personal projects, IT activities, etc. And maybe, just maybe, that would be useful for others.
